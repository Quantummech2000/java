# Learning Java on the GO

_Robert Sewell_
> If Java had true garbage collection, most programs would delete themselves upon execution. 

_Brian W. Kernighan_
> Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible,  you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.


## What is this Repo ?
Just like the kotlin programming repo, I have created this repo to post code dump of java classes which I write on my own.

## Why maintain this repo ?
This repo is like a reference book for me. I have organized all class files according to the order in which I learn the topics.

## How would it help me ?
You are free to use this code for usage of learning resources. For commercial usage please contact me in advance.

## Basic structure of Java class file 

```Java

public class myClass{
  public static void main(String[] args){
      //entry point for any java class file
  }
}
```
